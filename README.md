# Voltage Controlled Ring Oscillator with a wide tuning range and high frequency

This repo is being formed as a part of analog design hackathon by IITH. Design and results of the VCRO are presented.

# Introduction
A ring oscillator is a device composed of an odd number of NOT gates in a ring, whose output oscillates between two voltage levels, representing true and false. The NOT gates, or inverters, are attached in a chain and the output of the last inverter is fed back into the first. Ring oscillators can also be created using analog design, instead of inverters. The analog design in the ring oscillators is used to provide the Voltage control, wide swing.
